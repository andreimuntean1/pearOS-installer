# pere os instaler uwu

This is work in progress, it s nothing functional just yet.

# Important:

put the `list_disk` in `/usr/bin/` and do a `sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/list_disk` in order to make this installer at least show the disks available xD

# How do I run this?

Do the thing I mentioned in the important step, then:

```sh
npm -i
npm start
```

# What it does?

Installs the system on the selected disk.
Extremly important: it will use the WHOLE disk space.
All the data in the selected disk will be erased in the moment you press Continue
Looks a lot like the macOS's installer :))

# Current state

In this incomplete state, it DOES NOT eras none of your disks and it DOES NOT installs the OS. Because it's a work in progress, this current state of the installer just SIMULATES the installation progress.
